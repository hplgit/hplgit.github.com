===== Goal =====

The primary goal of this demo talk is to demonstrate how to write
talks with doconce and get them rendered in numerous HTML formats.

The talk investigates the accuracy of three finite difference
schemes for the ordinary differential equation $u&#39;=-au$ with the
aid of numerical experiments. Numerical artifacts are in particular
demonstrated.

# Comments explain various doconce constructs for common
# elements in talks about math and code.

# Purpose: section with multi-line equation.

======= Mathematical problem =======
label{math:problem}

idx{model problem} idx{exponential decay}


!bt
\begin{align}
u&#39;(t) &amp;= -au(t), \quad t \in (0,T],
label{ode}\\
u(0)  &amp;= I,
label{initial:value}
\end{align}
!et

where

 * $a$, $I$, and $T$ are prescribed parameters
 * $u(t)$ is the unknown function

!split

# Purpose: section with single-line equation and a bullet list.

======= Numerical solution method =======
label{numerical:problem}

idx{mesh in time} idx{$\theta$-rule} idx{numerical scheme}
idx{finite difference scheme}

!bpop
 * Mesh in time: $0= t_0&lt; t_1 \cdots &lt; t_N=T$
 * Assume constant $\Delta t = t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
 * $u^n$: numerical approx to the exact solution at $t_n$

Numerical scheme:
!bt
   \[
   u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
   \quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1
   \]
!et
!epop

!split

# Purpose: section with computer code taken from a part of
# a file. The fromto: f@t syntax copies from the regular
# expression f up to the line, but not including, the regular
# expression t.

======= Implementation =======

The numerical method is implemented in a Python function:

@@@CODE src/dc_mod.py  fromto: def solver@def verify_three

!split


# Purpose: subsection with inline figure (figure without caption).

===== The Crank-Nicolson method =====

===== The artifacts can be explained by some theory =====

!bpop
Exact solution of the scheme:

!bt
\[ u^n = A^n,\quad A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .\]
!et
!epop

!bpop
 * Stability: $|A| &lt; 1$
 * No oscillations: $A&gt;0$
 * Always for Backward Euler ($\theta=1$)
 * $\Delta t &lt; 1/a$ for Forward Euler ($\theta=0$)
 * $\Delta t &lt; 2/a$ for Crank-Nicolson ($\theta=1/2$)
