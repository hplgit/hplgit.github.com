<p style="font-size:80%">Much of the material in this document is taken from Appendix F in the book <a href="http://www.springer.com/mathematics/computational+science+%26+engineering/book/978-3-642-54958-8"><em>A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python</em></a>, 4th edition, by the same author, published by Springer, 2014.</p>

<h1 id="___sec12">A recipe for program writing and debugging </h1>

<p>
<b>1. Understand the problem.</b>
Make sure that you really understand the task the program is supposed
to solve.  We can make a general claim: if you do not understand the
problem and the solution method, you will never be able to make a
correct program. It may be argued that this claim is not entirely
true: sometimes students with limited understanding of the problem are
able to grab a similar program and guess at a few modifications, and
actually get a program that works. But this technique is based on luck
and not on understanding. The famous Norwegian computer scientist
Kristen Nygaard (1926-2002) phrased it precisely: <em>Programming is
understanding</em>.  It may be necessary to read a problem description or
exercise many times and study relevant background material before
starting on the programming part of the problem solving process.

<p>
<b>2. Work out examples.</b>
Start with sketching one or more examples on input and output
of the program.
Such examples are important for controlling the understanding of
the purpose of the program, and for verifying the implementation.

<p>
<b>3. Decide on a user interface.</b>
Find out how you want to get data into the program. You may want to
grab data from the command-line, a file, or a dialog with questions
and answers.

<p>
<b>4. Make algorithms.</b>
Identify the key tasks to be done in the program and sketch rough
algorithms for these.  Some programmers prefer to do this on a piece
of paper, others prefer to start directly in Python and write
Python-like code with comments to sketch the program (this is easily
developed into real Python code later).

<p>
<b>5. Look up information.</b>
Few programmers can write the whole program without consulting
manuals, books, and the Internet. You need to know and understand
the basic constructs in a language and some fundamental problem solving
techniques, but technical details can be looked up.

<p>
The more program examples you have
studied,
the easier it is to adapt ideas from an existing example to solve a new
problem.

<p>
<b>6. Write the program.</b>
Be extremely careful with what you write. In particular,
compare all mathematical statements  and algorithms with
the original mathematical expressions.

<p>
In longer programs, do not wait until the program is complete before
you start testing it, test parts while you write.

<p>
<b>7. Run the program.</b>
If the program aborts with an error message from Python, these
messages are fortunately quite precise and helpful.  First, locate the
line number where the error occurs and read the statement, then
carefully read the error message. The most common errors (exceptions)
are listed below.

<p>
<code>SyntaxError</code>: Illegal Python code.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  ccq-->
<pre><code>  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 5
    x = . 5
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Often the error is precisely indicated, as above, but sometimes
you have to search for the error on the previous line.

<p>
<code>NameError</code>: A name (variable, function, module)
is not defined.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  ccq-->
<pre><code>  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 20, in &lt;module&gt;
    table(10)
  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 16, in table
    value, next, error = L(x, n)
  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 8, in L
    exact_error = log(1+x) - value_of_sum
NameError: global name 'value_of_sum' is not defined
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Look at the last of the lines starting with <code>File</code> to see where in the
program the error occurs. The most common reasons for a <code>NameError</code> are

<ul>
  <li> a misspelled name,</li>
  <li> a variable that is not initialized,</li>
  <li> a function that you have forgotten to define,</li>
  <li> a module that is not imported.</li>
</ul>

<code>TypeError</code>: An object of wrong type is used in an operation.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  ccq-->
<pre><code>  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 17, in table
    value, next, error = L(x, n)
  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 7, in L
    first_neglected_term = (1.0/(n+1))*(x/(1.0+x))**(n+1)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Print out objects and their types (here: <code>print x, type(x), n, type(n)</code>),
and you will most likely get a surprise. The reason for a <code>TypeError</code>
is often far away from the line where the
<code>TypeError</code> occurs.

<p>
<code>ValueError</code>: An object has an illegal value.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  ccq-->
<pre><code>  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 8, in L
    y = sqrt(x)
ValueError: math domain error
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Print out the value of objects
that can be involved in the error (here: <code>print x</code>).

<p>
<code>IndexError</code>: An index in a list, tuple, string, or array is
too large.

<p>
<!-- begin verbatim block  ccq-->
<pre><code>  File &quot;somefile.py&quot;, line 21
    n = sys.argv[i+1]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<!-- end verbatim block -->
Print out the length of the list, and the index if it involves a variable
(here: <code>print len(sys.argv), i</code>).

<p>
<b>8. Verify the results.</b>
Assume now that we have a program that runs without error messages
from Python. Before judging the results of the program, set precisely
up a test case where you know the exact solution.  This is in general
quite difficult. In complicated mathematical problems it is an art to
construct good test problems and procedures for providing evidence
that the program works.

<p>
If your program produces wrong answers, start to <em>examine intermediate
results</em>.  Never forget that your own hand calculations that you use
to test the program may be wrong!

<p>
<b>9. Use a debugger.</b>
If you end up inserting a lot of <code>print</code> statements in the program for
checking intermediate results, you might benefit from using a debugger
as explained in the section <a href="._debug-solarized001.html#sec:debug:run">Using a debugger</a>.

<p>
Some may think that this list of nine points is very comprehensive.
However, the recipe just contains the steps that you should always
carry out when developing programs.  Never forget that computer
programming is a difficult task.

<p>
<blockquote>
    <em>Program writing is substantially more demanding than book
    writing. Why is it so? I think the main reason is that a larger
    attention span is needed when working on a large computer program
    than when doing other intellectual tasks.</em>
    Donald Knuth <a href="._debug-solarized005.html#Knuth85">[1]</a> (p. 18), computer scientist, 1938-.
